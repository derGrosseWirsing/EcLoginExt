# EcLoginExt LoginSecurityService Performance Analysis Report

**Date:** August 12, 2025  
**Plugin:** EcLoginExt  
**Service:** LoginSecurityService  
**Test Environment:** Shopware 5 Docker Container (laughing_mendel)

## Executive Summary

Performance tests were conducted to analyze the impact of using Doctrine transactions with query builder operations in the LoginSecurityService. The tests reveal significant performance overhead when using explicit transactions compared to auto-commit mode.

**Key Findings:**
- Transactions add **86.6% average overhead** to query execution time
- Failed login processes: **84.4% slower** with transactions
- Unlock processes: **88.8% slower** with transactions
- Memory usage impact is minimal
- Performance difference scales with operation complexity

## Test Results

### Simple Query Builder Operations
- With Transactions: 107.57ms (100 iterations)
- Without Transactions: 19.73ms (100 iterations)  
- **Performance Impact: +445.26%**

### LoginSecurityService Specific Patterns

**Failed Login Process (100 iterations):**
- With Transactions: 2064.64ms (avg: 20.646ms/op)
- Without Transactions: 1119.43ms (avg: 11.194ms/op)
- **Overhead: +84.4%**

**Unlock Process (100 iterations):**
- With Transactions: 1069.67ms (avg: 10.697ms/op)  
- Without Transactions: 566.43ms (avg: 5.664ms/op)
- **Overhead: +88.8%**

## Analysis

### Performance Impact Assessment: HIGH

With an average overhead of **86.6%**, transactions significantly impact query execution performance.

### Current Implementation Analysis

The LoginSecurityService implements transactions in:
1. `processFailedLoginInTransaction()` (Lines 326-348)
2. `unlockWithToken()` (Lines 108-137) 
3. `unlockCustomerAfterSuccess()` (Lines 530-542)

**Good Practices:**
- âœ… Batches multiple related operations within single transactions
- âœ… Proper rollback handling with try-catch blocks
- âœ… Commits at appropriate transaction boundaries
- âœ… Uses transactions for data consistency

## Recommendations

### KEEP CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION âœ…

**Rationale:** Data consistency is critical for security-related operations. The performance overhead is acceptable because:
- Login security operations are not high-frequency
- Data integrity is paramount for failed login tracking
- Current implementation properly batches related operations

### Monitor Under Load ðŸ“Š
- Implement performance monitoring for login operations
- Consider caching for frequently accessed customer data
- Monitor database connection pool usage during peak periods

## Conclusion

The current LoginSecurityService implementation strikes a good balance between performance and data integrity. The 86.6% transaction overhead is justified for security-critical operations that prioritize data consistency.

**Final Recommendation:** **KEEP CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION**
